At Amazon I was asked only coding, system design and (many) behavioral questions. Every interview started with 2-4 behavioral questions and lasted for 45 minutes.
Usually if they like your profile and you have a good technical chat with the recruiter (and if they are desperate to hire) they will wave the screening phone interview and take you directly on-site.
Coding questions were easy but total time was 30 mins or less.
On-site interviews were back to back and time enforced so that I literally couldn’t ask any questions. After getting the offer I was able to schedule 2 phone calls with a member of the team and the hiring manager to ask questions.
Coding questions
1 - Balanced parenthesis string:
warmup: write a method that returns a boolean indicating if a string made of rounded parenthesis is balanced
Second part: write a method that returns all the indexes of the parenthesis that need to be deleted to make the string balanced (if it’s unbalanced)
2 - given an array of stock prices, return an array of same size where each element contains the number of conscutive incresing values before and including the corrispondent element in the input array
Input: 30 29 45 49 55 40 30 31 32
